9. iterators for stl. how it shall be used ?
10. virtual inheritance and uses ?
11. Polymorphism - conceptually explain
12. difference between static library and dynamic library
13. difference between system call and library call - give example for system call
14. which cannot be overloaded constructor or destructor ?

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. set kth bit of an unsigned8 integer
2. x86 architecture experience ? EXSi exposure ?
3. call by value & call by reference - explain with code

1. given an new application how would you implement from scratch ? steps followed ?
2. diff between normal C and embedded C ?
3. how do you reduce executable size and optimize it in compile time ? - flags like strip to be enabled.
4. how do ensure from code if the ptr is deallocated or not ?
5. how do you choose in which language C/CPP/Python to use for new requirement ?
6. Difference between ARM and x86 architechture ?
7. How do you choose ARM or x86 processor to be used for a new requirement ?
8. what is the other constraint needed to be considered in choosing processor ?- ans: power drawn - ARM better
9. Singleton class and its need
10. how can you make an application run in kernel space - no device driver ? - rewrite entire kernel and customize
11. how an application in user space can communicate with hardware ?
12. how do you ensure your code is readable ?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
