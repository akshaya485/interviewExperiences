global and static variables - difference
need for protobuffers ?
built-in methods that get generated for proto variables ?
difference between mutex and semaphore ?
when an application already running - only one instance should run even though multiple invocations performed. how ?
various ways to communicate between 2 processes ?
why not use conditional_wait from mutex for signaling ? why semaphores ?
template class in CPP with a static variable within it. If multiple instances are created multiple copies of static variable created ?
